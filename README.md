# Project Snake
A very simple classic snake game developed for demo purposes powered by a custome engine I've developed.

Implemented with command based architecture, the snake can move forward in four directions and grows when eats the food. The game also supports boundless movement so that the snake find itself at the opposite side whenever they goes out of bounds on each axis.
