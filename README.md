A very simple classic snake game developed for demo purposes powered by my self-developed in-house engine.

Implemented with a command-queue based approach, the snake can move forward in four directions and grows when eats the food. The game also supports boundless movement so that the snake finds itself at the opposite side whenever it goes out of bounds on each axis.
